**Convex.jl** is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package for [Disciplined Convex Programming](http://dcp.stanford.edu/). Convex.jl can solve linear programs, mixed-integer linear programs, and DCP-compliant convex programs using a variety of solvers, including [Mosek](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Mosek.jl), [Gurobi](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Gurobi.jl), [ECOS](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/ECOS.jl), [SCS](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/SCS.jl), and  [GLPK](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/GLPK.jl), through [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl). It also supports optimization with complex variables and coefficients.

**Installation**: `julia> Pkg.add("Convex")`

## Quick Example

To run this example, first install Convex and at least one solver, such as SCS:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Convex")
Pkg.add("SCS")
```
Now let's solve a least-squares problem with inequality constraints.
```julia
# Let us first make the Convex.jl module available
using Convex, SCS

# Generate random problem data
m = 4;  n = 5
A = randn(m, n); b = randn(m, 1)

# Create a (column vector) variable of size n x 1.
x = Variable(n)

# The problem is to minimize ||Ax - b||^2 subject to x >= 0
# This can be done by: minimize(objective, constraints)
problem = minimize(sumsquares(A * x - b), [x >= 0])

# Solve the problem by calling solve!
solve!(problem, SCSSolver())

# Check the status of the problem
problem.status # :Optimal, :Infeasible, :Unbounded etc.

# Get the optimal value
problem.optval
```

## More Examples
A number of examples can be found [here](https://www.juliaopt.org/Convex.jl/stable/examples/). The [basic usage notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl/blob/master/examples/basic_usage.ipynb) gives a simple tutorial on problems that can be solved using Convex.jl. Many use cases of the package in complex-domain optimization can be found [here](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl/tree/master/examples/optimization_with_complex_variables).

Note: many of the examples are currently outdated (August 2019). Pull requests to update them are greatly appreciated!
